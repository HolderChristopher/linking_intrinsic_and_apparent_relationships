This project focuses on the research from the following journal article:

Holder, C. and Gnanadesikan, A.: Can machine learning extract the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth from large-scale observations? – A proof-of-concept study, Biogeosciences, 18, 1941–1970, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1941-2021, 2021.

The original version of the code (including scripts, functions, and source files) listed in the article can be found in the following Zenodo repository:

Christopher Holder, & Anand Gnanadesikan. (2020). Dataset and scripts for manuscript "Can machine learning extract the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton growth from large-scale observations? – A proof of concept study" (2021_02_05) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4511337

The original code from the article uses MATLAB. This scripts used in the particular Github project translate the MATLAB code into Python using Jupyter notebooks. Because a random number generator is used in two different programming languages, the results seen in this project may differ very slightly from the results listed in the manuscript. However, the main results and conclusions remain the same.
